# ethical-hacking-exercises
this repository is all about ethical hacking exercises and tutorial


This is a collection of tutorials and labs made for ethical hacking students, cybersecurity students, network and sys-admins. These tutorials accompy the resources of CEH content and different resources of CEH content and different resources across the internet.

The tutorial is very practical/hands-on.Don't worry if you are a completely noob, you don't need to be an expert to start learn ethical hacking. **Google is always your best friend.** This repo
will guide you very carefully from basics to more advanced techniques.

** Prerequisites**:
* Any computer with at least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
* At least 80GB of free disk space available.
* Hardware-based virtualization support.

*  * * 

** Disclaimer **:
* This is purely for educational purposes only. Do not try these techniques with any public network. Because if you are find guilty for causing any harm to any individual, government,
  corporate body, non-profit etc you will be sued with serious charges of cyber crime. I recommend you to practice the lessons in this course on your owned system and your own data in a private or local network. *

## Core Knowledge
First things first, you really need to understand how things work before start to disassembly and look for vulnerable components. The more you understand how things works, a better hacker you will be. The 'Core Knowledge' is just a jumpstart to these topics.

**Core knowledge provides a jumpstart to networking, linux systems, virtualization, lab building, scripting and also information security topics. If you are familiar on these topics you can skip it straight to Ethical Hacking module.**
